# Translate

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.
The project was a fun way of exploring cool features of Angular 2, RxJS and TypeScript. I was on a summer trip to Spain and wanted to keep track of some useful Spanish phrases and improve my Catalan :D. So build this fun project. You can translate common English phrases to Spanish and favorite them. Then you can see the list of your favorite phrases. Played around with the $http service, Observables, Ahead of Time Compilation and browser localStorage APIs. The project uses yandex Translation APIs for the translation from english to spanish. The demo is also up at http://evening-plains-46816.herokuapp.com/
