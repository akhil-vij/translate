# Translate

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.26.
The project was a fun way of exploring cool features of Angular 2, RxJS and TypeScript. Played around with the $http service, Observables, Ahead of Time Compilation. The project uses yandex Translation APIs for the translation from english to spanish. The demo is also up at http://evening-plains-46816.herokuapp.com/
